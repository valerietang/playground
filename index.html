    <h2>So... Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>I'm sure you've figured that my name is Val by this point. Although, for the sake of properly introducing myself... <br> Hi, I'm Valerie Tang, I'm from Toronto, and I'll be starting Year 1 Computer Science in the fall.</p>
   <br>
    <h4>Cool Stuff I've Done:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>wrote and published 2 books at the ages of 16 and 17</li>
        <li>flown a glider and a Cessna 182 Skylane plane (legit, I had the controls for 10 seconds LOL)</li>
        <li>recorded cover songs and filmed music videos for them all by myself just to prove that I could</li>
        <li>walked a red carpet for a movie premiere with my favourite cartoon character when I was 6</li>
    </ul>
   <br>
    <h4>Point is, I'm not a nerd... Well... not just a nerd... </h4>

<br><br>
  <h2>As For What This Site Is?</h2>
    <p>I suppose we can call it my homebase for whatever absurdity I think up in the tech realm. You'll find my projects here once I figure out what I'm doing. Meanwhile, enjoy the first ever game I've coded!'</p>

  <h2>If you're looking for my books?</h2>
  <p>GOOD LUCK... You won't be able to find them as I've taken both off the shelves. Maybe I'll write a revised version someday, not in the near future though.</p>
